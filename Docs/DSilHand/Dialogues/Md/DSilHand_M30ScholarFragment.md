**Player**:  I found another fragment. The mages were studying it.

**Fjol** (*Happy 70*): I can hardly believe it. Ysgramor must be helping us from Sovngarde.

**Player**: Also, Nelacar has given to me this letter.

**Fjol** (*Puzzled 50*): Let me see...    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 70*): That's remarkable! The mages of the College have discovered another possible location for the next fragment!    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Puzzled 60*): Dustman's Cairn... I'm familiar with that place.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Puzzled 50*): The letter states they were going to inform the Companions about the location...     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_4.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Surprise 50*): We must hurry! We need to make haste and be there as soon as possible.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_5.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): I'll mark the location on your map. And I'll make the arrangements to get some manpower there for the excavations.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_6.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*):  Meet me there as soon as you can. We can only pray we're not too late.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603D_7.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M30_FFLTopic03

**Player**: I'll be there!

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Good! But one last thing: I need to thank you for your efforts.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603F_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Take this weapon as a reward. It's a silver sword, but with an ancient tempering method using dwemer oil.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603F_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): This tempering makes it as hard and sharp as ebony. Sharper, perhaps    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FF_0001603F_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): Go talk with Kurdak if you want to learn more about it.

**Player**: Do you still have that silver ring to sell?

**Nelacar** (*Happy 60*): ...

#### DSilHand_M30_FMTopic01

**Player**: Are you Fjol?

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Indeed I am. I believe you're the new recruit, am I right?    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AC9_1.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M30_FMTopic02

**Player**: You are. We found the Wuuthrad fragment in Angarvunde's treasure.

**Fjol** (*Happy 100*): Is that so? Very commendable! We're one piece closer to finishing the puzzle!    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACB_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): As Krev may have let you know, we, the Silver Hand, have been searching for the pieces of Wuuthrad for nearly a decade now.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACB_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): It was shattered into twelve pieces hundreds of years ago. At the moment, the dogs in Whiterun have four pieces.    

``Datadound\VoicedDawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACB_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Happy 50*): But, with your help to thank, we've got our hands on five fragments.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACB_4.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M30_FMTopic03

**Player**: Dogs in Whiterun?

**Fjol** (*Disgust 50*): Yes. The Companions. The members of the Circle. They are lycanthropes, every single one.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACD_1.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M30_FMTopic04

**Player**:  Members of the Circle?

**Fjol** (*Anger 50*): Their guild leaders. The Companions claim to all be equals, and that was once true. A very long time ago.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACF_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Anger 50*): Now, every member of the Circle shares the same beast blood. Harbinger Terrfyg convinced them to pledge themselves to Hircine for savage power.

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015ACF_2.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M30_FMTopic05

**Player**: How do you know that?

**Fjol** (*Sad 50*): I'm afriad it's a long story. To be brief, Krev and I were invited to become beasts, and refused the "gift".     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AD1_1.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Anger 50*): But we refused to stay quiet with our knowledge. So now, they persecute us.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AD1_2.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Puzzled 50*): But enough talk about the past...  there will be another time for it. For now, I have a task for you.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AD1_3.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Please talk to an informant we have in Winterhold. His name is Nelacar.     

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AD1_4.xwm``    

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Just ask him if he still has that silver ring to sell. If he has any good news, he will find a way to tell you.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AD1_5.xwm``    


#### DSilHand_M30_FMTopic06

**Player**: Consider it done!

**Fjol** (*Neutral 50*): Good Brother/Sister! (Should figure out how to have a brother and sister variant based on gender) That's the spirit! Please, be discrete as possible. No one should know he is our informant.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleEvenTonedAccented\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M30_FM_00015AD3_1.xwm``
