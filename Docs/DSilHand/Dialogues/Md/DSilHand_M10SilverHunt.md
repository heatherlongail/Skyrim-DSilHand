# Quest DSilHand_M10SilverHunt

_It is the first quest for the mod Down of the Silver Hand. To start it, the player can talk with three different people: a spy on The Drunk Huntsman on Whiterun, the Gallow's Rock's guard, or the Driftshade Refuge's guard. In any case, the Gallows Rock's guard will give a quest to kill a Frost Troll and bring its Skull. After that, you will be allowed to talk to the Silver Hand leader, Krev the Skinner, and ask permission to join. Note: if you join the Companions before completing this quest, it will fail, and the Silver Hands will become hostile to you._

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleNord\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M10GMK_0000E96B_2.xwm``

#### DSilHand_M10GMK_Topic04

**Player**: What else?

**Krev The Skinner** (*Disgust 50*): We fight against werewolves to cleanse this foul daedric disease that has taken the sanity of many of our brothers and sisters here in Skyrim.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleNord\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M10GMK_0000EED4_1.xwm``    

**Krev The Skinner** (*Anger 50*): But worse than that, has corrupted the souls of many Nords of Skyrim, and taken them away from Sovngarde in exchange for an ephemeral power in life.    

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleNord\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M10GMK_0000EED4_2.xwm``

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleNord\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M10GMK_0000EED7_2.xwm``

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleNord\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M10GMK_0000EED7_3.xwm``

``Data\Sound\Voice\DawnOfTheSilverHand.esp\MaleNord\DSilHand_M_DSilHand_M10GMK_0000EED7_5.xwm``
