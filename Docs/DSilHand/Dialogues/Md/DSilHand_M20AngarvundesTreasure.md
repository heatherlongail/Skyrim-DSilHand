**Player**: I'm not sure.

**Krev The Skinner** (*Neutral 50*): The Wuuthrad axe is a legendary weapon owned by the great Nord hero, Ysgramor - the spiritual leader of our group.

**Krev The Skinner** (*Neutral 50*): His research makes him think that one of the fragments may be in a set of ruins in the Rift, and I trust his judgement.
